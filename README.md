## Motivation:

This repo is a collection of various guides (programming languagues, tools, theory) I collected over the time through Stack Overflow, MOOC, online tutorials, books, video lectures... 

I want to share what I have found to everyone, so that knowledge would be spread.

2. [Introduction to C++][2]
3. [Sublime Text tricks and tips][3]
4. [Vector in C++][4] - written by [Luong Vo](https://github.com/VoLuong)
